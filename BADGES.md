# Badges :partying_face:

We strongly believe good work should be rewarded! 

If you are someone who goes over and above what is expected, your README would be updated with a number of customised badges. 

### Well what do these customised badges come to use for? 

-  Your README is going to look pretty :grin:!

-  While evaluating your overall performance throughout the course of the project, these customised badges will act as a guiding light for us. Whether it be crafting the perfect LOR or recommending you for the perfect internship, customised badges will help us identify folks who go over and above what's just told.


*"Ok, you've convinced me, but how do I get them?"*

These are the badges that you could win : 

<img src="https://badgen.net/badge/AskMe/Anything/green?icon=awesome" > Help resolve doubts in the Discord/ Team community page and this badge is yours! </img>

<img src="https://badgen.net/badge/community/guru/red?icon=discord" > Constantly engage with the community. This could be as simple as adding links to useful articles/ helping the community learn something interesting that you learnt over the week by conducting sessions. Egnite is a community driven platform and if you are someone who comes across as a community champ, well we can't help but reward you! </img>

<img src="https://badgen.net/badge/demo/master/pink?icon=wiki" > Best demo of the project shall win this </img>

<img src="https://badgen.net/badge/clean/coder/blue?icon=visualstudio" > Writing code is an art! Code which is not readable and maintainable does not scale! As a single developer you can achieve only so much and it takes a village to rollout awesome products. We stand by the values of the [Clean Coder](https://blog.cleancoder.com/) and reward every individual who writes well documented, readable and maintainable code! The rules are simple, break your code into classes, add documentation, use good variable names and follow what Uncle Bob says! </img>


<img src="https://badgen.net/badge/lightning/speed/yellow?icon=bitcoin-lightning" > Performance, performance and performance! Well these are words you would hear a lot as a developer! One measure of it the speed at which your program executes! This badge of honour shall be rewarded to the ones whose code executes the fastest! </img>

<img src="https://badgen.net/badge/best/ux/orange?icon=sourcegraph" > If your UI isn't usable, well you can't sell your product! It not only needs to be visually appealing, but shall also be equitable, enjoyable, useful and usable! The best UX gets this reward for building something which we as users would put our bets on! </img>
